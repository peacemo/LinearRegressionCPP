# A simple implementation of linear regression with gradient descent.

## Notice

This lib just implement the basic linear regression for 1 weight and 1 bias, like: 

$Y = W^TX + b$

## Usage

cd to `src/source` and run `make` to build the executable file `linearRegression`.

Then run `./linearRegression` to see the result.

Run `make clean` to clean the executable file and the object files.
